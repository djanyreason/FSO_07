This repository is for exercises in Part 7 of Full Stack Open (FSO), "React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack" - https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7

The exercises in this part focus on front-end development in React. Many of them build upon projects developed in previous Parts of FSO, and contained in others of my repositories. Some interface with backend services, which in some cases are third-party services, others of which are contained in this repository.

The projects in this section focus on navigation within react apps using React Router, and creating custom react hooks. They also focus on styling react apps using CSS and ready-made UI libraries (e.g., Bootstrap, Material UI). 

There are four projects contained in this repository, each in their own subfolder:

* /routed-anecdotes- a web app that displays a list of software development anecdotes; uses React Router for navigation, and custom hooks
* /country-hook - a web app that searches for countries by a string entered, providing a list of all matching countries if multiple are found, and if only one is found additional details about that country; uses custom hooks
* /ultimate-hooks - a generic web app that interfaces with an API using a custom hook to handle multiple databases
* /bloglise - a web app that displays a list of blogposts stored in a database; uses React Router, custom hooks, and is styled with CSS and Bootstrap
